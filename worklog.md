At HBM with Mikey!

* made new project / repo, copied over design docs from BuddyKit repo
* sketched out rough diagrams

----------

Step one - connect with ride journal and log in.
Logging in gives the user payload, scheduled classes.
I don't think it has a token that it uses for subsequent uploads,
but includes username and password for say uploading stuff.

What to call this bit?  It'll be one of two(?) pipelines for Ride Journal.
RideJournal for now.

Added a LoginView with the username/password text field and the
lob-in button.
