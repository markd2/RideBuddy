# Ride Buddy

This is a SwiftUI (re) implementation of Cyclign Fusion's Ride Buddy Buckets,
done as part of a SwiftUI nerdCamp.

It's primarily a learning vehicle for learning SwiftUI and Combine, but
with the side effect of an app I'll be using for 2020 Winter Training, which
gives me motivation to continue working on it.  I tend not to learn stuff
if I don't actually use it for something Real.
