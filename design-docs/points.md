# Points

Points are calculated by minutes in zone:

* Zone 1:  1 point per minute
* Zone 2:  2 points per minute
* Zone 3:  3 points per minute
* Zone 4:  4 points per minute
* Zone 5:  6 points per minute

These are based on the Sally Edwards [Heart Zones](http://heartzones.com) system.

Users can use [Ride Journal](ride-journal.md) to plan workouts with a target
number of points, allocated to different zones based on the user's goals.
