# Ride Journal

[Ride Journal weblink](http://www.cyclingfusiontrainingcenter.com/RideJournal/RJHome.aspx)
is an online site for users to plan mulit-week indoor cycling training plans under the
guidance of a coach.

You can plan a week's ride, and Ride Journal will tell you "You need 15 minutes in
Zone 1, 35 in Zone 2", etc. As you do workouts, you won't hit the buckets (heh)
exactly, so Ride Journal takes that in to a acocunt.

Ride Buddy Buckets downloads the week's workouts (specifically, the user's zones,
and the time in each zone they should do) and offers them for the user, and then
uses that for calcuating the various targets.  

Sometimes the planned time (I can spend 60 minutes wednesday to work out), is
different from the needed time (You actually need 75 minutes to make your points). If
there's a large disparity, the user can choose between the two.
